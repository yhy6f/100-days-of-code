# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 16, 2022, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I followed along part I of this [Google Maps API tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6VxJoR3754), which was about rendering a Google map based on user's location via navigator.geolocation.

**Thoughts** I've recently started (re)learning Javascript, and I'm working toward a project that would render Google Map on the page. I shopped around on Youtube for tutorials and was glad I found this one, newer and shorter. Before I was able to follow along the tutorial, I had to sign up for the Google Maps API key. I was frustrated and confused because it required me to hop around a few different places - but eventually I got my key. I followed along the instructions and got a map to render

### Day 1: January 17, 2022, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I followed along part II of this [Google Maps API tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6VxJoR3754) on the  Places API, which allows users to type names of places and autocomplete their search.

**Thoughts** It was cool to see it work. A few small hickups were all because of typos. Need to be careful when typing next time! A few things that I'd like to improve on: making the map div height and width responsive to window size; and move the map view center to newly added marker.
