# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 16, 2022, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I followed along part I of this [Google Maps API tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6VxJoR3754), which was about rendering a Google map based on user's location via navigator.geolocation.

**Thoughts** I've recently started (re)learning Javascript, and I'm working toward a project that would render Google Map on the page. I shopped around on Youtube for tutorials and was glad I found this one, newer and shorter. Before I was able to follow along the tutorial, I had to sign up for the Google Maps API key. I was frustrated and confused because it required me to hop around a few different places - but eventually I got my key. I followed along the instructions and got a map to render

### Day 2: January 17, 2022, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I followed along part II of this [Google Maps API tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6VxJoR3754) on the  Places API, which allows users to type names of places and autocomplete their search.

**Thoughts** It was cool to see it work. A few small hickups were all because of typos. Need to be careful when typing next time! A few things that I'd like to improve on: making the map div height and width responsive to window size; and move the map view center to newly added marker.

### Day 3: January 18, 2022, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I made a basic UI for my pet adoption project with an input form. I tested out the petfinder API with curl, and tested out the endpoint URL using fetch(), and console.log the data I got back. I learned that you pass in the authorization token in a headers object into the second argument of fetch(), and that the humongous authorization token can be actually decoded using [this site] (https://jwt.io/). Next step is to tie the input with the endpoint URL together.

**Thoughts** Felt good that I made steady progress, even these are baby steps.

### Day 4: January 19, 2022, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: None. Taking a break as I didn't feel very well.

**Thoughts**: Guilty but not guilty.
